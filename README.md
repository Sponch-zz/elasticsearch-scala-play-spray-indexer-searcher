# Indexer and Searcher of Movies using Scala, Elasticsearch, Play and Spray #

The goal of this project was parse the actors and movies from a file and index these information to Elasticsearch. 
After that, build one REST API to do search by actor and return the movies that the actor have acted.

The project **search-actors-play-scala** uses Play Framework, while **rest-api-search-movies** uses Spray as Rest API

The three project are:

* [indexer-movie-script](https://github.com/Sponch/elasticsearch-scala-play-spray-indexer-searcher/tree/master/indexer-movie-script)
* [search-actors-play-scala ](https://github.com/Sponch/elasticsearch-scala-play-spray-indexer-searcher/tree/master/search-actors-play-scala)
* [rest-api-search-movies ](https://github.com/Sponch/elasticsearch-scala-play-spray-indexer-searcher/tree/master/rest-api-search-movies)

In each link do you have documentation about each component, how to install and run each one.
